This class was made thanks to the help of 2 online tutorials.
We're currently trying to find that tutorial again for proper credit and thanks.
Without the tutorials, we'd of not been able to properly get the Icon's functions working with the main program.


#How do I use this?

Add this file to your project, and inside of the Main.java file, after: "public void state(Stage primaryStage){"
simply add "EoZTrayIcon eoz_tray_icon = new EoZTrayIcon(primaryStage);"

*Do not forget to update EoZTrayIcon.java by adding the proper pacakge, and the proper path to the icon image.*
